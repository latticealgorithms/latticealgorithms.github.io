The goal of this site is to crowdsource information about algorithms for lattice problems that may someday have an efficient algorithm, namely, those in NP intersect CoNP. If you would like to contribute to the site publicly, privately, or anonymously, your help would be greatly appreciated!  Collaborations are also sought.  Contact latticealgorithms@gmail.
